# Example M-Pesa Payment Integration Config
# Copy this section into your config.yaml to enable M-Pesa payments

payments:
  enabled: true
  mpesa:
    # Get these from https://developer.safaricom.co.ke
    consumer_key: "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY_HERE"
    consumer_secret: "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET_HERE"
    
    # Your M-Pesa Business Shortcode (Paybill or Till Number)
    shortcode: "174379"  # Example shortcode
    
    # Lipa na M-Pesa Online Passkey (from Safaricom portal)
    passkey: "YOUR_PASSKEY_HERE"
    
    # Callback URL (where M-Pesa sends payment confirmations)
    # Must be publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint
    callback_url: "https://yourdomain.com/mpesa/callback"
    
    # Use sandbox for testing (true) or production (false)
    sandbox: true

# How it works:
# 1. Customer places order and provides delivery location
# 2. Hive sends STK Push to customer's phone
# 3. Customer enters M-Pesa PIN to complete payment
# 4. M-Pesa sends confirmation to your callback URL
# 5. Order is confirmed once payment is received

# Note: You need to implement the webhook handler at callback_url
# See docs/MPESA_INTEGRATION.md for complete setup guide
