# 🐝 For Builders — Start Here

**You don't need to be a developer to build with Hive.**

This is your starting point. Everything you need to go from "I want a WhatsApp bot" to "My bot is live" — in under 10 minutes.

---

## 🎯 What You're Building

A **WhatsApp bot** that runs on YOUR device (no cloud needed). It can:

- Take orders (food delivery, products)
- Book appointments (salon, tutoring, viewings)
- Sell tickets (events, classes, workshops)
- Handle support (tickets, FAQs, inquiries)
- Create & redeem vouchers
- Track everything in a dashboard

**All through WhatsApp messages. No app. No website. No monthly fees.**

---

## 🚀 Quickest Path (5 Minutes)

### Use the Wizard

```bash
# Download Hive (one binary, ~5MB)
# See: https://github.com/kalkiboru111/hive/releases

# Make it executable (Mac/Linux)
chmod +x hive

# Run the wizard
./hive wizard my-business
```

**Answer 4 questions:**
1. What type of business? (food, salon, events, etc.)
2. Business name?
3. Currency?
4. Your WhatsApp number?

**Done.** Your bot config is ready.

```bash
# Run it
./hive run my-business/
```

**Scan the QR code with WhatsApp. Your bot is live.**

## 🛠️ What You Edit

**One file:** `config.yaml`

It's plain text. No code. Just:

```yaml
business:
  name: "Your Business Name"
  currency: "USD"
  welcome: "Welcome message here"

menu:
  - name: "Item 1"
    price: 10.00
    emoji: "🍕"
```

**That's it.** Change the values, add items, save. Restart the bot. Changes are live.

## 📖 Learn by Example

### Example 1: Food Delivery Bot

```bash
./hive init --template food-delivery mama-kitchen
cd mama-kitchen
```

**Edit `config.yaml`:**
- Change business name to "Mama's Kitchen"
- Update currency to KES
- Replace menu items with your dishes
- Add your WhatsApp number to `admin_numbers`

**Run:**
```bash
../hive run .
```

**Test:**
- Message bot → get welcome
- Reply "1" → see menu
- "order 1" → place order
- Admin gets notification

**See full guide:** [docs/BUILDERS_GUIDE.md](docs/BUILDERS_GUIDE.md#example-food-delivery)

./hive init --template salon-booking my-salon

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Start with a Template
Don't build from scratch. Pick the closest template, customize it.

### 2. Test Before Announcing
Run through the full flow yourself:
- Place an order
- Check admin notification
- Mark it complete
- Verify customer gets confirmation

### 3. Keep It Simple
Start with 3-5 menu items, not 50. Test, iterate, expand.

### 4. Use the Dashboard
Open `http://localhost:8080` to manage orders, edit menu, create vouchers — all without touching the config.

### 5. Run on a Spare Device
Use an old phone or laptop so your main machine doesn't need to stay on 24/7.
